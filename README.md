# Hello!
Movies app made according to the documentation here: https://goatlys.notion.site/Android-Take-Home-Assignment-Atlys-5261382ae3b34140adc097e305c533a9

# Important Note:
The Movies DB API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) DOES NOT work on the Jio Network. I have a Jio Wi-Fi at home and can confirm that the 
API simply times out even when trying to open their website. Request you to please use another network for any testing. Regret the inconvenience caused.
